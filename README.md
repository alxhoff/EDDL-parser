# EDDL-parser
A Flex/Bison parser for EDDL files. This is being used for a proof of concept project and may not be developed into a complete parser as that is at the moment not required for my project. If anything this work will show anyone how to start developing a parser for text files/EDD files.

## Building

```make
make
```

## Running

```bash
./scanner < example_eddl.edd
```
